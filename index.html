  Gotta have some comments in there.

  An idea for the ole website:

  I wanted it to be old school style but maybe it should be regular but with a button that switches it to old school.

        I have 2 cats! They are called:

        I like a lot of different foods but here are 3 foods I cannot abide, in order of distaste:
        <ol>
          <li>Seafood/fish</li>
          <li>Egg (on its own, fine if it's incorporated in a cake or something)</li>
          <li>Milk (I'd have it with cereal but I wouldn't drink the milk after)</li>
        </ol>

        Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. 
        <a href="#" target="_blank">Valus Ta'aurc</a>. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. 
        He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
