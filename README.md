1. Created this repository using the GitHub guide and followed the guide (https://pages.github.com/) to get a website set up on GitHub Pages. Hopefully that has worked. Next I need to add an index file.

2. Created an index file! Website seems to work (lopezelpesado.github.io) and I think I've got the hang of Atom. I've been able to publish a change in the index file to make it say YO!!! I wanna make my website have an old computer terminal feel like in Alien and like my "Please stand by" card I made for my stream. I'll start by setting the background to black, changing the font to green and choosing a good font (hopefully I'll be allowed to use the font I use for my stream).

3. OK so when I make changes to a file I can press ctrl+s (save) and then my changes got to the Git panel as unstaged changes, I can then make them staged and then type a commit message, commit them to main and then push them to GitHub (I think that's how that works).

1. Matched the text colour with my Twitch channel. Will change the font to be more old school computer-y.

1. Not many updates recently as I've been doing JS. Yvonne said that most people use VS Code so I'm using that now and am gunna test how that works. Will update the text on the website to try and get the hang of pushing from here.
