This README is for my website and will have track changes I make and the things I've learned/resources I've used to make the changes.

Changes:

1. Created this repository using the GitHub guide and followed the guide (https://pages.github.com/) to get a website set up on GitHub Pages. Hopefully that has worked. Next I need to add an index file.
